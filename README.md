# Impact-of-Remote-Work-on-Mental-Health-Analysis
This project analyzed the impact of remote work on mental health, focusing on work-life balance, job roles, and industries. The analysis identified trends in employee satisfaction, remote work support, and industry-specific differences among 5,000 employees.

The following insights were uncovered from the analysis:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

Employees aged 52â€“61 have the highest average work-life balance rating, suggesting that late-career employees might have established routines that enhance balance.

There is a fairly even split among employees working remotely, in hybrid roles, and onsite, with a slight preference for remote work. Employees in remote and hybrid work settings report better work-life balance than onsite employees.

Work-life balance ratings are the lowest in manufacturing and healthcare industries compared to retail and IT.

Finance, IT, and Healthcare have the most job roles, suggesting these sectors are highly represented.

The majority of employees (around 33%) remain neutral about remote work satisfaction.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Leverage the experience of this age group to mentor younger employees on work-life balance strategies. Consider creating peer mentorship programs to share best practices across age groups

Continue supporting remote work options, as they align with employee preferences. Invest in technology and virtual collaboration tools to ensure productivity across all work locations.

Introduce stress management programs, flexible shifts, mental health programs and review workload distribution for employees in these sectors.

Prioritize industry-specific resources and support for these sectors. For example, provide targeted training programs and mental health resources to address the unique challenges in Finance, IT, and Healthcare.

Conduct surveys to understand neutral responses and adjust remote work policies to improve satisfaction.
